# nats-server configuration

This folder contains several scripts to help out setting up the nats-server configuration.

You can run each script individually, or you can use one of the wrapper scripts.

## docker-compose

 Create a directory where you want your docker compose files, and enter that directory
 
 Clone the steward repository:

```bash
mkdir my_dir
cd my_dir
git clone https://github.com/RaaLabs/steward.git
```

Execute the wrapper script with the following arguments:

`./steward/scripts/nats-server/wrapper.sh <LetsEncrypt Cert file> <LetsEncrypt Key file> <nats-server listen port>`

```bash
./steward/scripts/nats-server/wrapper.sh ../some/dir/le.crt ../some/dir/le.key 50222
```

This will create all files needed, but you need to add user configuration to the **nats.conf** file manually.

A template for the central steward instance are added by default, but **you need** to edit the file and replace the **`FILL-IN...`** fields with your central user key, and **organization name** according to the naming you want to use as node names. **Read more about the naming in the main README.md.**

**NB**: LetsEncrypt certificate can be generated by using <https://github.com/RaaLabs/certupdater>
